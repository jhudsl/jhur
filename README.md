# jhur Package:

The goal of `jhur` is to provide accompanying functions for the
Introduction to R class at Johns Hopkins. We have moved away from this in teaching the course, as we found it was better for students to practice importing data. 

## Installation

You can install `jhur` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jhudsl/jhur")
```
